Every modern company, lives, thrives by their ability to match supply with demand.

Supply chain makes it affordable for consumers, profitable for companies in a global economy.

Logistics is defined as the movement and storage of goods, services, and related information.

logistics is essential in today’s global interconnected supply chains, where we can bring companies together through transportation, warehousing, and inventory management.

There are many aspects to consider when selecting the most suitable mode of transport. 

- **_Cost of Transport_**: Costs can vary based on the type and amount of goods that need to be transported.
- **_Reliability and Regularity of Service_**: Decision on which mode of transport to use will be influenced by the urgency and speed by which you would like your goods to be delivered. 
- **_Safety_**: Safety and security of goods in transit also influence which mode of transport to use.

## Modes of Transportation

###  **Motor Freight:**

Motor freight is also very efficient in a financial sense. Because the roadways are paid for by the government and ultimately the taxpayers, it’s a subsidised industry

Advantages

-    **_Speed:_** it’s very fast.
-    **_Reliability:_** Trucks rarely break down, and if they do, it’s only for a very short amount of time.
-    **_Low damage:_** Items do not get damaged very often
-    **_Accessibility:_** Trucks can pretty much get anywhere.
 
Terminals  
Terminals are taking products from one truck, sorting them, and then moving them out on a different truck

*   **_Relay terminals:_** we just switch out the cab and put a trailer on a new cab
*   **_Pickup and delivery:_** we go from a city truck to a line-haul vehicle
*   **_Cross-dock terminals:_** we connect networks of transportation together

Operations

*   **_Truckload (TL)_**: Moved directly from shipper to consignee.
*   **_Less-than-Truckload (LTL)_**: Picked up, moved to a terminal, reloaded for line-haul, delivered to terminal, locally delivered.
*   **_Parcel_**: Home/business pickup, consolidated, moved to sortation facility.

###  **Air Freight**

when speed outweighs cost, Air Transportation is the way to go

Advantages

*   **_Speed_**: You can get it there as fast as possible.
*   **_Capacity_**: You are able to ship a wide variety of products by plane.
*   **_Accessibility:_** You can get to pretty much any destination.

Characteristics

When the importance of speed outweighs cost, then air is attractive for freight!

*   Emergency shipments
*   Typical commodities include mail, communications products, racehorses, etc.
*   Speed, travel time advantage can be off-set by flight frequency and timing
*   Smaller communities have experienced reduced frequencies
*   In-direct routing due to hub and spoke networks

### **Intermodal**

Intermodal means that we take a container and put it on a train, As a basic rule, whenever we use containerised freight, we can actually seamlessly transfer from one mode to another.

There we combine train and truck to use both modes most efficiently. We gain an advantage by using trucks for pickup and delivery. And we get to use rail for the long haul, where it is much cheaper because rail is very fuel efficient and cost effective

This form of intermodal transportation maximizes the advantages of one mode, and minimizes the disadvantages of the other mode. So, we use trucking where it is more efficient. We use rail, where it’s more efficient. And, the whole transportation overall becomes cheaper

Advantages

*   **_Cost_**: long distances rail transportation has a significant advantage over trucks in terms of fuel efficiency  which translates into a large cost advantage.
*   **_Distance_**: On long distances (over 500 miles) rail is not much slower than truck
*   **_Accessibility_**: by combining the advantages of rail and truck, the freight can reach any spot a regular truck could reach
