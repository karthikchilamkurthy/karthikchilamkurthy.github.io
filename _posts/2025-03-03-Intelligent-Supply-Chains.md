## **_What is AI and Decision Intelligence Platform, and how can they be used in supply chains?_**

Let’s put aside the buzzwords like AI, Generative AI, and intelligence for a moment, and focus on a practical example, like a shoe company, which we discussed in the previous blog. For any supply chain, there are numerous processes at each stage, starting from planning, production, warehousing, transportation, and, ultimately, customer excellence.

At the heart of these processes, AI and Decision Intelligence play a crucial role in providing actionable insights. Each stakeholder in the supply chain—whether it’s a planner, warehouse manager, or transportation lead—has their own set of tasks. To optimize these tasks, massive amounts of data are required at every stage, and understanding the challenges within each process is key to driving action across the supply chain network.

For a planner to make informed decisions, two things are essential:

- **_Intelligence_**

- **_Visibility of data_**

Decision Intelligence platforms do not simply rely on AI models—they also incorporate advanced data engineering. This combination allows planners to gain visibility into surrounding data. For example, a transportation manager can view data from various sources such as warehouse stock levels, truck schedules, customer orders, and empty hauls. With an AI model running on top of this data, intelligent recommendations are generated, enabling better decision-making.

## **_Uses of Decision Intelligence Platform_**

- **_Cost Optimization_**: Improves cost-efficiency by optimizing pricing, inventory, and logistics, AI-powered insights enable smarter resource allocation and reduce costs across production, distribution, and storage in the supply chain.

- **_Loss Prevention_**: Minimizes financial loss through damage monitoring, and waste reduction. Anomaly detection helps in preventing product damage, and minimize waste through predictive maintenance and demand forecasting.

- **_Risk Management_**: Identifies and mitigates risks through disruption forecasting and supplier risk assessment, AI models predict risks from global events, weather changes, and supply disruptions, enabling supply chains to adapt swiftly and minimize impact.

- **_Decision-Making in Uncertainty_**: Enables faster, data-driven decisions during market shifts or disruptions, Algorithms analyze vast data sets to offer real-time recommendations, helping supply chain leaders make informed decisions amid changing conditions.

- **_Performance Monitoring_**: Tracks key performance indicators for continuous improvement and real-time adjustments. AI tools continuously monitor supply chain performance, providing real-time feedback and actionable insights for process optimization and efficiency.


In the next section, we'll explore how this integration works with concrete examples, showing how AI models can assist in optimizing supply chain operations in real-time.
The ultimate goal of Supply chain analytics is to create an efficient supply network!
