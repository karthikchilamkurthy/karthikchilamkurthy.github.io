## **_What is AI and Decision Intelligence Platform, and how can they be used in supply chains?_**

Let’s put aside the buzzwords like AI, Generative AI, and intelligence for a moment, and focus on a practical example, like a shoe company, which we discussed in the previous blog. For any supply chain, there are numerous processes at each stage, starting from planning, production, warehousing, transportation, and, ultimately, customer excellence.

At the heart of these processes, AI and Decision Intelligence play a crucial role in providing actionable insights. Each stakeholder in the supply chain—whether it’s a planner, warehouse manager, or transportation lead—has their own set of tasks. To optimize these tasks, massive amounts of data are required at every stage, and understanding the challenges within each process is key to driving action across the supply chain network.

For a planner to make informed decisions, two things are essential:

- **_Intelligence_**

- **_Visibility of data_**

Decision Intelligence platforms do not simply rely on AI models—they also incorporate advanced data engineering. This combination allows planners to gain visibility into surrounding data. For example, a transportation manager can view data from various sources such as warehouse stock levels, truck schedules, customer orders, and empty hauls. With an AI model running on top of this data, intelligent recommendations are generated, enabling better decision-making.

## **_Uses of Decision Intelligence Platform_**

- **_Cost Optimization_**: The core strength of the DI platform lies in its ability to centralize and visualize data across the entire process. This enables planners to make proactive, data-driven decisions without needing to constantly engage with multiple stakeholders for information. By having access to all relevant data in one place, planners can save significant time and effort. Additionally, AI-powered insights and recommendations from advanced algorithms further support decision-making, allowing planners to make more informed, efficient choices.

- **_Loss Prediction_**: Every decision made by a planner is inherently linked to potential losses, such as supply wastage, production inefficiencies, or increased backhaul costs. The DI platform, by providing intelligent and data-driven recommendations, offers actionable insights for mitigating these risks. For example, it can suggest production adjustments or improvements to transportation networks. With the platform's ability to analyze and reason based on real-time data, planners are equipped with the tools they need to make informed decisions that help prevent supply chain losses and reduce wastage. This proactive approach ensures more efficient and cost-effective operations.

- **_Weak Link Analysis_**: In a supply chain, interconnected processes such as production, warehouse management, transportation, and customer excellence must work in harmony to ensure efficiency. A weak decision in one process can create vulnerabilities throughout the chain, impacting overall performance. The DI platform acts as a vital agent, facilitating seamless communication between these processes, allowing them to collaborate and make informed trade-offs. By visualizing and addressing weak links, such as low production of a critical material, the platform helps prevent disruptions and optimize the entire supply chain. This proactive, data-driven coordination ensures aligned decisions, improves efficiency, and reduces risks across the network.

- **_Performance Monitoring_**: Tracks key performance indicators for continuous improvement and real-time adjustments. AI tools continuously monitor supply chain performance, providing real-time feedback and actionable insights for process optimization and efficiency.

- **_StakeHolder Alignment_**: While recommendations and decisions are crucial, their value is lost if they cannot be effectively executed. The real challenge lies in altering the network to implement the decisions made by planners or stakeholders. The DI platform addresses this by leveraging advanced data engineering capabilities, seamlessly integrating with enterprise systems like SAP, OMP, and o9. This integration allows the platform to translate strategic decisions into actionable steps on the ground, ensuring they are communicated and executed across production sites, warehouse managers, and other key areas. In doing so, the DI platform bridges the gap between decision-making and real-world execution, driving tangible improvements in supply chain operations.

The ultimate goal of Supply chain analytics is to create an efficient supply network!

In the next section, we'll explore how this integration works with concrete examples, showing how AI models can assist in optimizing supply chain operations in real-time.

## **_Decision intelligent Production Planning_**

Let's examine Supply production planning for a shoe company, comparing traditional actions with intelligent decision-making processes. We'll explore how decision intelligence platforms influence network operations and the impact they have on optimizing production strategies.
