## **_What is AI and Decision Intelligence Platform, and how can they be used in supply chains?_**

Let’s put aside the buzzwords like AI, Generative AI, and intelligence for a moment, and focus on a practical example, like a shoe company, which we discussed in the previous blog. For any supply chain, there are numerous processes at each stage, starting from planning, production, warehousing, transportation, and, ultimately, customer excellence.

At the heart of these processes, AI and Decision Intelligence play a crucial role in providing actionable insights. Each stakeholder in the supply chain—whether it’s a planner, warehouse manager, or transportation lead—has their own set of tasks. To optimize these tasks, massive amounts of data are required at every stage, and understanding the challenges within each process is key to driving action across the supply chain network.

For a planner to make informed decisions, two things are essential:

**_Intelligence_**
**_Visibility of data**_
Decision Intelligence platforms do not simply rely on AI models—they also incorporate advanced data engineering. This combination allows planners to gain visibility into surrounding data. For example, a transportation manager can view data from various sources such as warehouse stock levels, truck schedules, customer orders, and empty hauls. With an AI model running on top of this data, intelligent recommendations are generated, enabling better decision-making.

In the next section, we'll explore how this integration works with concrete examples, showing how AI models can assist in optimizing supply chain operations in real-time.
The ultimate goal of Supply chain analytics is to create an efficient supply network!
